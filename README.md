# Digital Queue Token & Waiting-Time Management System 🎫

An efficient, real-time web application designed to modernize physical and virtual queuing experiences by providing live token tracking and accurate waiting-time estimations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Digital Queue Token & Waiting-Time Management System** is a streamlined web solution designed to modernize the way people wait for services. By replacing traditional physical paper tokens with a dynamic digital interface, the system eliminates the need for crowded waiting rooms and provides users with the freedom to manage their time elsewhere while keeping an eye on their progress in the queue.

This project was developed by **Team 4** as part of the **Project Building Session** conducted by **TinkerHub CEAL** to prepare for high-pressure hackathons and industry-level development.
